# pxt-pulse-test
Test version of the pxt pulse blocks, for exposure to makecode

This is for development of unstable code that can be tested at makecode.microbit.com

makecode pxt imports use a URL, so branching code does not seem to be possible.  This means that development takes place in test repos and is then committed to the main repo once tested adequately.
